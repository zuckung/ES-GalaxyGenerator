        The following values don't really need changes. (StarRadius, Density, Tries)
        <br>
        To understand how system generation work, here a short explanation: The first system will
        get generated at <Startpos>, then a circle with <StarRadius> is drawn around and for
        <Tries> times a system is tried to get generated on the border of that circle. Then the
        focus moves to the first new generated system and all restarts. After <density> of
        successful system creations, the focus system jumps back to the first system, and
        everything restarts.
  - type: input

      label: StarRadius
      description: Enter a number representing the distance from current system to generated system. (max. 200, 100 looks best)

  - type: input
    attributes:
      label: Density
      description: Enter a number representing the amount of system generations, before restarting to try to generate more system at the first system. (max. 20, higher means more long galaxy arms)
      value: "5"

      required: true
  - type: input
    attributes:
      label: Tries
      description: Enter the number for re-tries to generate a new system from the current system. (max.20, higher means a more dense core)
      value: "15"
